ClojureExperiment
=================

Working on programming assignments to learn clojure. Typically 
I write each program in LISP style then using clojure's tail
recursion.

Problems Solved (so far)
--
* factorial 
* power function
* lists
    * finding missing element (two lists)
    * binary search
    * maximum value
    * merge (two sorted lists)
    * find missing element using binary search
    * permutations
      * lazy (from stackoverflow)
      * my approach (not performant)

Usage 
---
    brew install leiningen
    lein run
